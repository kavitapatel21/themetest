**✔ Generate barcodes for WooCommerce products, orders and emails**
**✔ Embed barcodes into invoices and third party plugins**
**✔ Support of CODE128, QRCode, UPC, EAN, Data Matrix, CODE39, Base64, ZATCA QRCode.**

This plugin allows you to extend functionality of your WooCommerce store by adding barcodes to product pages and any other places.
After plugin installation you need to enable a few settings to display barcodes in next places:

1. Product pages
2. Order emails
3. Admin product pages
4. Admin order pages

Size of the barcode can be adjusted in "px" or "%", so it can perfectly fit to website layout.
You can also select the position of the barcode where it should be displayed on "Product page" - you can find a list of positions in your template documentation.

This "Barcode Embedding" plugin also allows to add barcodes into invoices or any other third party plugins by using shortcodes.
Embedding barcodes with shortcodes might be a tricky task, so you may need help from your developer or just [contact us](https://www.ukrsolution.com/ContactUs) and we will help you with it.

Your customers can use a barcode scanner or app on your smartphone to read information from barcodes.

*Note: this is a demo version with some limitations.*
*You can upgrade to the full version on our [website](https://www.ukrsolution.com/Wordpress/Digital-Barcode-Generator-for-Embedding-into-Pages-and-Posts).*

### Integration with WooCommerce
 
Plugin fully supports WooCommerce and allows to display any data on barcodes from products and orders.
For example, you can add to barcode product name, price, attributes and any custom fields.
Or add extra text data for order barcode, like "order id", "date of creation", etc.
If you need any additional data on barcode simply [contact us](https://www.ukrsolution.com/ContactUs) and we will help you.

### Barcode templates

Plugin offers a few barcode templates that will allow you to display more data on it.
There are templates for barcode with a single line of text and up to 4 lines of text.
So, you can select a template based on how much text data you would like to display on barcodes.
If you are looking for some specific barcode template - [contact us](https://www.ukrsolution.com/ContactUs) and we will create it for you.

### Embedding barcodes using shortcodes

Shortcodes can be used for embedding barcodes into the most difficult parts on your website.
With a little help from a technical person you can add barcodes in almost any place on your website.

You can create a new shortcode on "Embed Barcode" tab where you can:

1. Select template
2. Select type of barcode (CODE128, QRCode, UPC, EAN, DataMatrix or CODE39)
3. Select field from which should be barcode image generated
4. Match text lines 1-4 with actual product or order fields.
